## 🚀 What I do

I’m a Backend Engineer working on **core banking and billing** for **BanQi (digital bank)** via **Invillia**.

I design, build, and evolve services that:

- Process **millions of transactions per month** (boletos, TED/PIX, payment webhooks).
- Run on **AWS**, leveraging **event-driven architectures**, retries and DLQs to keep **high availability**.
- Follow **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID** and **TDD**, with a strong focus on automated testing and observability.

Day to day, I work on:

- **Node.js / NestJS / TypeScript microservices** for financial and payment flows.
- **Integrations** with external partners and platforms (core banking, ledger, gateways, etc.).
- **CI/CD pipelines**, **CloudWatch dashboards/alerts**, DLQs and runbooks to reduce MTTR and recurring incidents.

## 🔍 How I like to build systems

- **Domain-first**: model the business (payments, core banking, reconciliation) before thinking about controllers and endpoints.
- **Testable & observable**: services with meaningful tests, logs, and metrics — not black boxes in production.
- **Resilient by design**: timeouts, retries, idempotency, DLQs, and clear reprocessing flows.
- **Clear contracts between teams**: integration checklists, tracing, useful logs, and lightweight alignment rituals.

## 🤝 Beyond code

- Actively participate in **code reviews**, definition of standards, and helping teammates with architecture, testing, and AWS.
- Enjoy discussing **DDD, Clean Architecture, event-driven systems, payments, and core banking**.
- Always aiming to grow as an **engineer** (not just a “coder”), connecting technical decisions to real business impact.
